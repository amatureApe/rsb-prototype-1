                            validate can be done so by Ready Set Bet.

                            publicly knowable. Any question from "Will Bitcoin hit $X USD by the end of 2023?" to
                            "Will Irvine, California reach 100Â°F sometime within the next 7 days?" to "Will the Jets win
                            the next SuperBowl?" and everything in between can be asked. There are two sides available for
                            each bet, the Affirmation and the Negation. The user may choose whether they want to affirm or
                            negate the bet contract as specified in the wording. The opposite side will become available for
                            purchase on the open market.

                            the specific collateral token. For more information please refer to the UMA documentation.

                            Users are able to add an expiry timestamp for their bets. The expiry timestamp uses the UTC
                            Unix Epoch format rounded to the nearest second. The expiry timestamp represents the minimum
                            epoch by which the bet is able to be settled by UMA. For example, a bet such as "Will the S&P 500
                            drop more than 5% by the end of 2022?" should have its is expiry timestamp be set to 1672531200,
                            or Jan 1st 2023 12:00AM UTC. This will prevent users from unnecessarily requesting bet validation
                            before it is settleable.

                            The validation reward is an additional reward given to UMA validators beyond the standard
                            bond fee. While optional, it is recommended to add extra validation rewards for bets that
                            are either handling large sums of money or are complex enough in nature to warrant additional
                            fees. Keep in mind that the UMA protocol utilizes game theory tokenomics to incentivize humans
                            to validate your questions. Make sure to pay enough to make it worth a human's time to validate
                            your request. Refer to the UMA documentation for more information.

                            The liveness period is the amount of time, measured in seconds, that is available for dispute
                            resolution for the validation process. UMA recommends a standard 2 hour liveness period for most
                            requests, however the user is able to change this parameter for their specific needs. Contracts on
                            a shorter timeframe that are not handling large sums of money may utilize a shorter liveness period
                            and contracts handling large sums of money may be better suited with a longer dispute resolution period.
                            After a bet contract has been validated, users will need to wait the length of the liveness period
                            before they are able to settle the contract and claim their funds. For more information please refer to
                            the UMA documentation.
